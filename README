Delocalize
==========

Highly experimental date/time and number parsing.

Use at your own risk! ;-)

More details to come ... In the mean time, take a look at the test helper to find out how you can define input formats for dates. Number formats should be there anyway if you have a localized app.

TODO
====

* Improve test coverage
* Separate Ruby/Rails stuff to make it usable outside Rails
* Verify correct behavior with time zones
* Implement AM/PM support
* Cleanup, cleanup, cleanup ...
