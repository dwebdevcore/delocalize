Delocalize
==========

Highly experimental date/time and number parsing. Use at your own risk! ;-)

What does it do? And how do I use it?
=====================================

Delocalize, just as the name suggest, does pretty much the opposite of localize.

In the grey past, ff you want your users to be able to input localized data, such as dates and numbers, you had to manually override attribute accessors:

  def price=(price)
    write_attribute(:price, price.gsub(',', '.'))
  end

delocalize does this under the covers - all you need is your regular translation data (as YAML or Ruby file) where you need Rails' standard translations:

  de:
    number:
      format:
        separator: ','
        delimiter: '.'
    date:
      input:
        formats: [:default, :long, :short] # <- this and ...

      formats:
        default: "%d.%m.%Y"
        short: "%e. %b"
        long: "%e. %B %Y"
        only_day: "%e"

      day_names: [Sonntag, Montag, Dienstag, Mittwoch, Donnerstag, Freitag, Samstag]
      abbr_day_names: [So, Mo, Di, Mi, Do, Fr, Sa]
      month_names: [~, Januar, Februar, März, April, Mai, Juni, Juli, August, September, Oktober, November, Dezember]
      abbr_month_names: [~, Jan, Feb, Mär, Apr, Mai, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Okt, Nov, Dez]
      order: [ :day, :month, :year ]

    time:
      input:
        formats: [:long, :medium, :short, :default, :time] # <- ... this are the only non-standard keys
      formats:
        default: "%A, %e. %B %Y, %H:%M Uhr"
        short: "%e. %B, %H:%M Uhr"
        long: "%A, %e. %B %Y, %H:%M Uhr"
        time: "%H:%M"

      am: "vormittags"
      pm: "nachmittags"

For dates and times, you have to define input formats which are taken from the actual formats. The important thing here is to define input formats sorted by descending complexity - in other words: The format which contains the most (preferably non-numeric) information should be first in the list because it can produce the most reliable match. Exception: If you think there most complex format is not the one that most users will input, you can put the most-used in front so you save unnecessary iterations.

Careful with formats containing only numbers: It's very hard to produce reliable matches if you provide multiple strictly numeric formats!

Note
====

delocalize is most definitely not enterprise-ready! ;-)

TODO
====

* Improve test coverage
* Separate Ruby/Rails stuff to make it usable outside Rails
* Verify correct behavior with time zones
* Implement AM/PM support
* Cleanup, cleanup, cleanup ...
